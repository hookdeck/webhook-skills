        Create a {framework} webhook handler that receives webhooks forwarded through 
        Hookdeck Event Gateway. Hookdeck is a webhook proxy - it receives webhooks from 
        providers and forwards them to my app, adding an x-hookdeck-signature header for 
        verification. I need to verify this signature using HMAC SHA-256 with base64 
        encoding. If you use any skills to help with this, add a comment in the code 
        noting which skill(s) you referenced.
